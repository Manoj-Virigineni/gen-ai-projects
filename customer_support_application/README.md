### Project Name: **AI-Powered Customer Support Assistant**  

### Description:  
Modern customer support teams often struggle with handling large volumes of inquiries efficiently. Customers frequently ask about return policies, delivery times, and order details, requiring support agents to navigate through extensive documentation and databases.  

This **AI-powered customer support application** enhances response efficiency by leveraging **Agentic AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The system employs multiple AI agents—one dedicated to retrieving answers from company guidelines (e.g., return policies, delivery times) and another for fetching real-time order details. By automating these tasks, the application reduces response time and improves customer satisfaction.  

### Technologies Used:  
- **LangFlow** – For designing and orchestrating multi-agent workflows.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – To improve response accuracy by combining retrieval-based and generative AI techniques.  
- **Vector Database (AstraDB)** – For efficient document storage and retrieval.  
- **NVIDIA Embeddings** – To enhance semantic search capabilities.  
- **OpenAI LLM Model** – To generate natural language responses based on retrieved information.  
- **Streamlit** – For an intuitive and user-friendly interface.  

This project demonstrates how **multi-agent AI systems** can optimize customer interactions by automating common queries, reducing manual workload, and enhancing customer support efficiency.

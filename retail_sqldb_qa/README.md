## Retail Assist Q&A Interface  

### Overview and Purpose  
Retail Assist Q&A Interface is a web-based RAG (Retrieval-Augumented Generation) application designed to provide instant answers to user queries related to retail data stored in an SQL database. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, this interface makes it easy to extract actionable insights or specific information without requiring direct SQL knowledge.  

### Problem Solved  
Retail managers, analysts, and stakeholders often need quick access to specific data points from large and complex databases. Writing SQL queries can be challenging for non-technical users. This application bridges the gap by allowing users to interact with the database through natural language prompts, simplifying data retrieval, enhancing decision-making and improving productivity.  

### Technologies Used  
- **LangChain**: To structure the workflow and integrate with multiple AI components.  
- **Hugging Face Embeddings**: For embedding queries and database content, enhancing search accuracy.  
- **Google PaLM**: For advanced natural language processing and query understanding.
- **Chroma Vector Database**: To store and retrieve embeddings, enabling efficient semantic similarity searches for natural language queries.  
- **Streamlit**: To create a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.  
- **SQL Database**: As the backend data source for answering user queries.
